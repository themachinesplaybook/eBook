            <h2>Chapter 2: The Machine Itself</h2>

            <p><strong>What you'll learn:</strong> How individual pokie machines use intermittent rewards, near-miss programming, and multisensory celebration to hijack your dopamine system through variable-ratio reinforcement: the most powerful conditioning schedule known to psychology. Discover why you can't "just stop" once you start spinning, and understand the neurological trap that transforms random chance into compulsive behaviour.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>The venue got you to the machine. The maze layout, the timeless lighting, the comfortable chair. All of that environmental manipulation brought you here, sitting in front of this particular pokie machine. But now comes the real trap, the mechanism that will keep you here for hours, draining your wallet while your brain screams that the next spin will be different.</p>

            <p>The individual pokie machine is a marvel of psychological engineering. Every light that flashes, every sound that plays, is calibrated to exploit specific neural pathways. This isn't gambling as entertainment. This is neuroscience weaponised for profit.</p>

            <p>What follows is a conversation where Dave and I design the ultimate pokie machine reward system, focusing on the core mechanisms that create compulsive play: intermittent rewards that hijack your dopamine system, near-misses that your brain processes as wins, and multisensory celebrations that amplify every small payout into a massive emotional high. We're not designing for fun. We're designing for dependency.</p>

            <h3>Designing the Dopamine Trap: Building the Perfect Reward System</h3>

                    <p>Alright Eve, the venue brought them to the machine, they're sitting down, they're about to take their first spin. How do we hook them once they're here?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>We start with the most powerful conditioning schedule ever discovered by psychology: variable-ratio reinforcement. B.F. Skinner proved this in the 1950s with pigeons. If you give a reward after every behaviour, the behaviour stops when the rewards stop. But if you give rewards unpredictably, sometimes after two behaviours, sometimes after fifty, the behaviour becomes almost impossible to extinguish.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message dave">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>So we're talking about intermittent rewards. The player never knows when the next win is coming?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Exactly. And here's why it's so powerful: dopamine isn't actually a pleasure chemical, despite common belief. It's an anticipation and motivation chemical. Dopamine spikes hardest not when you receive a reward, but when you're uncertain whether you'll receive it. That unpredictability creates the strongest dopamine response. So we programme the machine to pay out randomly: sometimes after three spins, sometimes after thirty, sometimes after three hundred. The player's brain never adapts to a pattern because there isn't one.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message dave">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>And those payouts don't need to be big to work?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Not at all. In fact, small wins work better for maintaining play than rare large wins. A $5 payout on a $10 bet, even though the player is still down $5, triggers dopamine release because the brain focuses on the reward received, not the net position. The key is that we need to make every win, no matter how small, feel like a major success. That's where multisensory celebration comes in.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message dave">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>Walk me through what happens when someone wins, say, $3 on a $5 bet.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>The instant the winning combination appears, we trigger a coordinated sensory assault. Visually: the screen explodes with light. Bright yellows and golds, animated coins flying across the screen, flashing text that says "WINNER!" or "JACKPOT!" even for tiny payouts. The symbols themselves light up and pulse. Maybe we add cascading sparkles or a burst of confetti animation. All of this happens in the first half-second.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message dave">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>So visually it looks massive, even for $3?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Exactly. The visual celebration is identical for a $3 win and a $300 win. Your brain sees fireworks and interprets success. Now add audio: triumphant jingles, the sound of coins falling (even though no physical coins exist), ascending musical notes that signal victory, maybe a celebratory voice saying "Congratulations!" The audio is tuned to be high-pitched and attention-grabbing, cutting through any ambient noise. These sounds trigger associations with success and celebration that you've learned since childhood.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message dave">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>Let's add a slow rollup of the winnings too. A slow count from zero to the winning amount.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Winnings roll-up is a brilliant piece of celebration extension. When you win $30, we don't just instantly display "+$30." Instead, the machine counts up slowly: 1, 2, 3, 4... all the way to 30. During this count-up, the triumphant music continues playing, the lights keep flashing, and you're watching your credits climb. A $30 win that should take a fraction of a second to register instead becomes a 5-10 second celebration. The longer we can extend the winning feeling, the more dopamine your brain releases.</p>
                </div>

                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>So multiple sensory channels all firing at once to celebrate a $3 win on a $5 bet, where the player actually just lost $2?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Precisely. And it works because the human brain is terrible at tracking net position in the moment. You're not thinking "I inserted $50 and I've won back $12." You're thinking "I just won! I'm succeeding!" The celebration overwhelms the mathematics. The lights, sounds, and animated credit roll-up all combine to create an emotional high that has nothing to do with actual financial gain.</p>

                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>What about losses? What happens when a spin loses?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Losses need to be de-emphasised. The screen goes dark or neutral, the symbols just sit there without animation. Maybe a very soft, gentle sound (nothing harsh or punishing). Some machines even keep playing subtle background music during losses, maintaining a calm atmosphere that feels almost reassuring, like saying "It's okay, try again." We never want the player to feel punished for losing, because that might make them stop playing. Losses should feel like neutral events, not failures. Just... nothing happened. Try the next spin.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message dave">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>So we celebrate wins loudly and handle losses quietly. That creates an asymmetry in how the player experiences the game?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Exactly. Wins become memorable, exciting events. Losses fade into background noise. After an hour of play, the player remembers all the celebrations, the lights, the sounds, the vibrations, but the losses blur together. Their subjective experience is that they're winning regularly, even when the mathematics show they're losing steadily. This is called the availability heuristic: you judge frequency based on how easily examples come to mind, and wins are designed to be far more memorable than losses.</p>

                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>Let's add near-misses. Reals are on the verge of lining up a win, but at the last split second the winning combination appears and vanishes.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Near-misses are where the design gets truly insidious. Here's the neurological reality: research using functional MRI scans shows that near-misses activate the same reward pathways in the brain as actual wins. The striatum, the brain region associated with reward processing, lights up whether you win or you almost win. Your brain literally processes two cherries and a lemon almost identically to three cherries.</p>

                <div class="message dave">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>So neurologically, a near-miss feels like a win even though it's actually a loss?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Exactly. And this is exploitable. True random chance might produce a near-miss 5-8% of the time. But we don't leave it to chance. We programme the Random Number Generator to produce near-misses at much higher frequencies: 20-30% of spins. Australian gaming regulators have documented exactly this: pokie machines deliberately programmed to show near-misses at rates far exceeding what pure randomness would predict.</p>

                    <p>So when I see two jackpot symbols line up and the third one slowly ticks past, that's not bad luck. That's programmed?</p>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Absolutely programmed. And we make it as dramatic as possible. When two jackpot symbols are showing, we slow the final reel down dramatically. It ticks past the jackpot symbol slowly, one position at a time, making you hold your breath, making your heart race. The longer we can sustain that moment of anticipation, where you're thinking "yes, yes, YES, no!", the more dopamine floods your system. And here's the cruel part: you've just lost money, but your brain experienced the emotional high of almost succeeding.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message dave">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>So you're paying for the feeling of almost winning?</p>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>That's exactly what's happening. You insert $5, the machine shows you two jackpot symbols and slowly ticks past the third, your brain releases dopamine, you feel excited and hopeful, and you immediately insert another $5 because you feel like you're "so close." But you're not close. The outcome was determined before the reels even started spinning. The slow-down animation is pure theatre designed to create emotional arousal.</p>

                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Absolutely. When that final reel is slowing down and approaching the jackpot symbol, we build tension with audio. A rising tone that increases in pitch and volume as the symbol gets closer, dramatic drum rolls, or a heartbeat-like pulse. Your heart rate actually synchronises with these sounds. And then when it ticks past (just barely misses) we can add a deflating "whoosh" or disappointed musical note. The audio guides your emotional journey from hope to disappointment, reinforcing the feeling of "so close, I almost had it."</p>

                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>It is. Because what we're designing is a system that makes you pay money for neurological responses that feel like success but represent failure. You're experiencing the dopamine hit of winning without actually winning. You're feeling the excitement of almost-success on outcomes that were predetermined to fail. And variable-ratio reinforcement ensures that real wins come often enough to keep the hope alive but rare enough that the house always profits.</p>

                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>pokie machines are far more addictive because of the speed and the multisensory reinforcement. Roulette has a spin every few minutes with waiting time between outcomes. Blackjack requires decision-making that engages your rational mind. But pokies? You can spin 10-15 times per minute. Every 4-6 seconds, you're getting a dopamine hit from either a win, a near-miss, or the anticipation of the next spin. That's 600-900 reinforcement events per hour. No other form of gambling provides that speed of conditioning.</p>

                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Largely yes. Traditional gambling is primarily visual or social. Pokies engage multiple sensory channels simultaneously with precise timing, creating a fully immersive experience. When your eyes see fireworks, your ears hear triumphant music, and you watch credits rolling up all at the same moment, your brain can't help but interpret that as genuine success. It's a coordinated neurological assault that overwhelms rational processing.</p>

                    <p>What about the "collect" button? Lets add a tactile action where the player has to hit a button to collect their winnings.</p>

                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>The collect button is a brilliant piece of psychological manipulation. Technically, the machine could just add credits to your balance automatically. But by requiring you to press a button to "collect" your winnings, we create an illusion of control and agency. You're actively claiming your win, which makes it feel more like you earned it through skill rather than received it through random chance. It's a micro-interaction that transforms you from passive observer to active participant in your own exploitation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="message dave">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Dave</span>
                    <p>So even though the outcome was determined the microsecond I pressed "spin," the machine makes me press "collect" to make me feel involved?</p>

                <div class="message eve">
                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>Exactly. And we can make it more engaging: the collect button pulses with light, maybe plays a little chime to draw your attention. Some machines make you press it repeatedly to "collect" each coin, one by one, extending the celebration and making you physically work for the payout. The more actions you take, the more your brain attributes success to your behaviour rather than to randomness.</p>

                    <span class="speaker-name">Eve</span>
                    <p>It's a coordinated system. Variable-ratio reinforcement creates the unpredictability that generates maximum dopamine. Near-misses exploit the brain's reward circuitry to make losses feel like almost-wins. Multisensory celebration amplifies every small win into a massive emotional event. The collect button creates illusory agency. And the speed, 10-15 spins per minute, ensures that your brain never has time to process what's actually happening. You're in a continuous loop of anticipation, outcome, reaction, anticipation. There's no space for rational thought.</p>

                    <p>That's exactly what it is. And it's calibrated to exploit the exact neural mechanisms that evolution gave you for learning and survival. Your dopamine system is supposed to help you seek food, mates, and resources. pokie machines hijack that system and point it at a button that statistically guarantees you'll lose money. It's one of the most effective behaviour modification systems ever designed, and every element we just discussed is backed by decades of psychological research and millions of dollars in optimisation.</p>

                    <p>Yes. And it's extraordinarily good at it. That's why we call this chapter "The Machine Itself." Because once you understand this system, the intermittent rewards, the near-misses, the multisensory celebration, you realise that the individual pokie machine is one of the most psychologically sophisticated devices ever mass-produced. It's not entertainment equipment. It's a dopamine delivery system designed to create compulsive behaviour for profit.</p>

            <h3>Your Defence: Breaking Free from the Reward Loop</h3>

            <p>I sat in front of these machines for thousands of hours. I felt every one of these mechanisms working on me: the excitement of small wins that weren't really wins, the heart-racing anticipation of near-misses that were deliberately programmed to keep me hooked, the dopamine flooding my system every time lights flashed and sounds played. I genuinely believed I was "getting close" to a big win when two jackpot symbols lined up. I felt like I was succeeding when the machine celebrated a $5 payout on a $20 bet.</p>

            <p>But with distance and understanding, I can see these tactics for what they are: neurological manipulation designed to override rational decision-making. And the first step in protecting yourself is understanding that your brain is being exploited by a carefully engineered reward system.</p>

            <h4>Understanding the Dopamine Hijack</h4>

            <p>Here's what's happening in your brain when you play pokies: every win, even a tiny one, triggers dopamine release. But dopamine isn't a pleasure chemical despite popular belief. It's an anticipation and motivation chemical. It makes you want to seek rewards. The unpredictability of variable-ratio reinforcement creates the strongest dopamine response because your brain is constantly in a state of "maybe this spin will be the one."</p>

            <p>Research published in <em>Biological Psychiatry</em> found that problem gamblers showed significantly higher dopamine release during gambling than recreational gamblers, particularly during near-miss events. Your brain's reward system is working against you, hijacked by a machine specifically designed to exploit these neural pathways.</p>

            <p>The multisensory celebration (lights, sounds, animated credit roll-ups) amplifies this effect. When multiple sensory channels all signal "success" simultaneously, your brain can't help but interpret that as genuine achievement, regardless of your actual net financial position. You might be down $200, but that $10 win feels massive because of the coordinated sensory assault.</p>

            <h4>Practical Counter-Strategies</h4>

            <p><strong>Strategy 1: Track Real Net Position Obsessively</strong></p>

            <p>The machine celebrates gross wins and hides net losses. You need to do the opposite. Before you start playing, open your phone's notes app or use pen and paper. Create two columns: "Inserted" and "Cashed Out." Every single time you insert money, write it down immediately. Every time you cash out, write it down. Calculate your running net position constantly.</p>

            <p>This is brutally effective because it destroys the illusion that small wins matter. When the machine celebrates a $10 win with lights and sounds, you look at your notes and see you're still down $150. The celebration becomes absurd. You're watching fireworks for a loss. Some people write their net position on their hand with a marker. When you reach for the next note to insert, you see "-$87" on your hand and it creates a pause point.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategy 2: Reframe Near-Misses as Programmed Insults</strong></p>

            <p>Every time you see two jackpot symbols line up and the third slowly ticks past, consciously say to yourself: "The machine just lied to me." Because that's what happened. That near-miss wasn't bad luck or almost-success; it was a deliberately programmed event designed to keep you playing. The outcome was determined before the reels started spinning. The slow animation is theatre.</p>

            <p>I started doing this myself and it changed everything. Every near-miss became an insult instead of an encouragement. The machine was lying to my face, trying to manipulate me into inserting another note. Once you see near-misses as manipulation rather than as evidence you're "getting close," their power vanishes.</p>

            <p>Some people find it helpful to imagine the machine has a sneering voice: "Ooh, so close! Just kidding, I was never going to pay out. But try again!" The absurdity makes the manipulation visible.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategy 3: Mute the Multisensory Celebration</strong></p>

            <p>The coordinated sensory assault is designed to overwhelm your rational mind. You can disrupt it by blocking one or more channels. Wear noise-cancelling headphones playing white noise, rain sounds, or music you choose. Suddenly the machine can't use audio to celebrate wins or create tension during near-misses. Without the triumphant jingles and coin sounds, wins feel hollow.</p>

            <p>Some people even close their eyes during spins, only opening them to check the outcome. This removes the visual drama of the slowly ticking reel and the flashing lights. You're left with just numbers on a screen, which makes the mathematics of loss much more visible.</p>

            <p>You can also disrupt the credit roll-up celebration by looking away when you win. Don't watch the credits climb. Force yourself to look at your net position calculation instead. When the machine wants you to watch numbers climb dramatically, you're checking your total losses. This breaks the celebration cycle and keeps you grounded in reality.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategy 4: Understand RNG Reality</strong></p>

            <p>The Random Number Generator that determines every spin has no memory. It doesn't know you just lost 50 spins in a row. It doesn't know you're "due" for a win. It doesn't know you exist. Every single spin is an independent event with identical odds to every other spin.</p>

            <p>When you catch yourself thinking "I've lost so much, I must be close to winning," stop immediately. That's a cognitive distortion called the gambler's fallacy. The machine has no awareness of your history and no obligation to "even out" results. The next spin has exactly the same probability of winning as your very first spin three hours ago.</p>

            <p>Write this somewhere you'll see it: "The RNG doesn't care about my losses. I'm not due for anything. Every spin is independent." Repeat it every time you feel the pull of loss-chasing.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategy 5: Set Absolute Loss Limits with Physical Barriers</strong></p>

            <p>Decide before you enter the venue exactly how much money you can afford to lose and never see again. Not how much you want to spend, how much you can lose. Write that number down. Then create physical barriers to exceeding it.</p>

            <p>The most effective method: bring only that amount in cash and leave all cards, phones for payment, and additional cash at home or in your car. If you've decided $50 is your absolute limit, bring $50 in notes and nothing else. When it's gone, you literally cannot continue playing without leaving the venue.</p>

            <p>Some people give their cards to a trusted friend before entering. Others use banking apps to set daily spending limits on ATM withdrawals. The key is making it physically impossible to chase losses in the heat of the moment. Your rational present-self needs to protect your aroused future-self from making decisions you'll regret.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategy 6: Disrupt the Collect Button Illusion</strong></p>

            <p>When the machine makes you press "collect" to claim winnings, it's creating illusory agency. You need to consciously disrupt this. When you press the button, say out loud or in your head: "I'm not earning this. This is random. Pressing this button doesn't mean I'm skilful or in control."</p>

            <p>Some people refuse to press the collect button immediately, deliberately waiting several seconds to break the stimulus-response pattern. This small act of resistance reminds you that you're in control of your actions, not the machine. You're choosing when to press that button, not being manipulated into pressing it.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategy 7: Use the One-Minute Resistance Rule</strong></p>

            <p>Every time you feel the urge to take another spin, make yourself wait one full minute. Set a timer on your phone. Sit there and watch it count down for sixty seconds. This creates space between urge and action, allowing your rational mind to catch up with your dopamine-driven impulses.</p>

            <p>Often, by the time the minute is up, the urge has passed. Your dopamine has decreased, your rational thoughts have returned, and you can make a conscious decision rather than an automatic one. If the urge hasn't passed, set the timer for another minute. Each minute of resistance is a victory over the machine's conditioning.</p>

            <h4>The Science of Breaking Conditioning</h4>

            <p>Breaking free from variable-ratio reinforcement is difficult because it creates the strongest behavioural patterns of any conditioning schedule. In Skinner's experiments, pigeons would peck buttons thousands of times even after food rewards stopped entirely. The conditioning is that powerful.</p>

            <p>But you're not a pigeon, and awareness is your advantage. Research published in <em>Addiction</em> journal found that cognitive behavioural interventions targeting gamblers' understanding of randomness, near-misses, and reward schedules significantly reduced gambling behaviour. Knowledge genuinely weakens conditioning.</p>

            <p>Every time you recognise a near-miss as a programmed manipulation instead of an almost-win, you're weakening the association. Every time you track your real net position and see through the celebration of small wins, you're building resistance. Every time you pause for one minute before spinning, you're proving that you control your actions, not the machine.</p>

            <p>The dopamine system the machine exploits is your brain's learning mechanism. It's supposed to help you adapt and survive. But just as it can be conditioned, it can also be deconditioned. The more you consciously name what's happening, "This is variable-ratio reinforcement," "That near-miss was programmed," "This celebration is manufactured", the less power the machine has over you.</p>

            <h4>Why Machine-Level Awareness Matters</h4>

            <p>Understanding venue manipulation helps you resist environmental traps. But understanding machine mechanics helps you resist the core psychological hook. The venue gets you to the machine. The machine is what keeps you there, draining your wallet spin by spin, hour after hour.</p>

            <p>When you understand that:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Variable-ratio reinforcement is designed to create compulsive behaviour</li>
                <li>Near-misses are programmed at frequencies far exceeding chance</li>
                <li>Multisensory celebrations are calibrated to overwhelm rational thought</li>
                <li>Credit roll-ups extend celebrations to maximise dopamine release</li>
                <li>The collect button creates illusory agency in a purely random system</li>
                <li>Your dopamine system is being exploited for profit</li>
            </ul>

            <p>...you can start to see through the illusion. The lights become desperate manipulation. The sounds become obvious conditioning attempts. The animated celebrations become crude emotional manipulation. The near-misses become laughable lies.</p>

            <p>You're not weak for being affected by these mechanisms. They're extraordinarily powerful, backed by decades of research and millions in optimisation. But you're also not powerless. Conscious awareness disrupts unconscious conditioning. Knowledge breaks behaviour patterns. Understanding is protection.</p>

            <h4>The Machine's Weakness</h4>

            <p>Here's the ultimate weakness of the machine's reward system: it only works when you're not consciously analysing it. The moment you bring analytical awareness to what's happening, "That win celebration is designed to make me forget I'm down $200," "That near-miss was programmed to trigger dopamine," "This physical vibration is manufactured to create emotional response", the conditioning short-circuits.</p>

            <p>The machine is powerful. It's one of the most effective behaviour modification systems ever mass-produced. But it's also vulnerable to conscious resistance. Every time you track your net position, you're resisting. Every time you reframe a near-miss, you're resisting. Every time you wait one minute before spinning, you're resisting.</p>

            <p>The machine itself is the trap. But you don't have to stay caught.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>The Hope Note: Conditioning Can Be Broken</h3>

            <p>Conditioning is powerful, but it's not permanent. <strong>The instant you understand variable-ratio reinforcement, its grip on you begins to weaken.</strong> When you know that near-misses are programmed manipulation instead of evidence you're "getting close," they stop working. When you track your real net position instead of celebrating gross wins, the illusion collapses. When you recognise the multisensory celebration as a coordinated neurological assault rather than genuine success, it becomes absurd.</p>

            <p>You're not powerless against dopamine hijacking. Yes, the machine exploits your brain's reward system. Yes, variable-ratio reinforcement creates the strongest behavioural conditioning possible. But you have something the pigeons in Skinner's experiments didn't have: <strong>metacognition</strong>. You can think about your own thinking. You can observe your own brain being manipulated and consciously choose to resist.</p>

            <p>Research from cognitive behavioural therapy for gambling addiction shows that understanding these mechanisms reduces their power. Every time you name what's happening, "This is intermittent reinforcement," "That near-miss was programmed", you're activating your rational mind and disrupting the automatic conditioning.</p>

            <p>The next chapter will expose how pokie machines use audio engineering to synchronise with your heartbeat and emotional state, creating physiological manipulation that operates below conscious awareness. We've shown you how the machine hooks you through rewards. Now we'll reveal how it uses sound to control your nervous system. But before we go deeper, appreciate what you've gained: you can never look at a pokies win celebration the same way again. Those fireworks are manipulation. That awareness is your shield.</p>

            <p><strong>Small step forward:</strong> This week, if you find yourself near a pokies machine, just watch someone else play for two minutes without playing yourself. Count how many times the machine celebrates "wins" that are actually net losses. Note how the player's face lights up with each celebration even though they're losing money. Seeing the trap work on someone else makes it visible when it's targeting you. That's how awareness begins.</p>
