## 📖 About This Book

This book is about understanding a machine. Not the metal and circuits kind, but the psychological kind. The kind that knows exactly which buttons to press in your brain, which rewards to dangle just out of reach, and which moments of hope to manufacture to keep you coming back. The kind of machine that cost me over $200,000 before I finally understood what I was up against.

I'm Dave, and I spent years feeding pokies machines across Australia. Not because I was weak, or foolish, or lacking willpower. I lost that money because I was outmatched. The people who designed these machines understood human psychology better than I understood myself. They built a system that exploited vulnerabilities I didn't even know I had.

But here's what changed everything: I stopped trying to beat the machine at its own game. Instead, I learned to think like the people who built it. I studied the psychology, the design principles, the deliberate manipulation tactics. And once I understood the playbook, once I could see the manipulation for what it was, the spell broke.

**This book is that playbook.**
