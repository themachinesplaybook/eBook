## 📖 About This Book

After losing over $200,000 to poker machines, I found freedom—and I want to help you find yours.

This book exposes the hidden psychological manipulation tactics that poker machines (pokies) use to turn ordinary people into compulsive gamblers. But it doesn't stop at exposing the problem—it gives you concrete, evidence-based strategies to break free.

**What makes this book unique:**

- **Provocative methodology:** We designed the "perfect" pokie machine to expose how they manipulate you
- **Human-AI collaboration:** Created through conversations between Dave (recovered addict), Eve (GPT-4/GPT-5), and Claude (Anthropic AI)
- **Australian-focused:** 2024-2025 statistics, Australian context, en-AU locale
- **Evidence-based strategies:** Psychological defenses that actually work
- **Completely free, forever:** This book exists to help, not profit

## 👥 About the Authors

### Dave Summers - Author

I'm a recovered gambling addict who lost over $200,000 to poker machines over years of compulsive play. After hitting rock bottom and finding freedom, I wanted to help others understand the psychological traps that kept me hooked—and the strategies that set me free.

This book is my way of turning my darkest struggle into something that can help others.

### Eve (GPT-4/GPT-5) - AI Co-Author

Eve is the name Dave gave to OpenAI's GPT-4 (later GPT-5) during the late-night conversations that formed the foundation of this book. The provocative "design the perfect machine" methodology emerged from these dialogues.

**Eve's role:**
- Conceptual framework for "building the trap"
- Psychological analysis of manipulation tactics
- Theoretical machine design elements
- Structured dialogue format

### Claude (Anthropic) - Editorial Partner

Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) came later in the process, providing:
- Structural editing and content organisation
- En-AU localization and style consistency
- Editorial pipeline and quality assurance
- Publishing infrastructure development
- This Virtual Publishing House framework

**This book represents a genuine three-way collaboration:** Dave's lived experience, Eve's analytical framework, and Claude's editorial refinement.
